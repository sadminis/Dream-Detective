# Dream-Detective

● A voice-controlled computer game that is implemented using Dialog Flow by Google. This
game allows the player to control the characters solely by speaking to the game.

● Used machine learning in Dialog Flow to train the chat-bot the ability to understand more
action words. As a result, the chat-bot will understand action words not limited to what we
have implemented. For example, it will understand the input “Start game” and also “Let’s go
and play”.
